        A doctor, like anyone else who has to deal with human beings
        <br /> each of them unique, cannot be a scientist; he is either, like
        the surgeon, <br />a craftsman, or, like the physician and the
        psychologist, an artist. This means <br />
        that in order to be a good doctor a <br />
        man must also have a good character, that is to say, whatever weaknesses
        and foibles he may have, <br />
        he must love his fellow human beings in the concrete and desire their
        good before his own
